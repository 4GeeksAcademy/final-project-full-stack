# Full-Stack Final Project
<!--endhide-->

![Final Project Architecture](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/final-project-full-stack/blob/main/docs/assets/preview.png?raw=true)

It's time to think about what you are going to be building. You'll have to develop an entire product, prepare a presentation & demonstrate the product and the idea to family, friends and hiring partners.

This project should be started after you have taken the class about Agile Development because you will have to create User Stories and a Kanban Board.

## üìù Instructions

1. Start the project using the academy's [Full-Stack boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-flask-hello) that contains Front-End and Back-End all together.
2. Add all your user stories into the [repository's issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), as it will be the main repository for your project specs.
3. Please create a [Github Kanban Automated Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) with the KANBAN columns: Backlog, Todo, Doing, Done.
4. Now add the issues into the project as cards and plan for your first iteration.


## Technological Requirements for the project

1. Several Pages (for example: Home page, Login Page, Profile Page, etc.)
2. User authentication (Login + Signup + Forgot Password).
3. Custom made API with Authentication.
4. 3rd party API integration (embeds and iframes don‚Äôt count); it has to be a back-end integration.
5. React.js application using Flux and React Router.
6. Anything else the student wants to add.


## Methodology Requirements

1. The project must have between 3 - 4 team members.
2. Start by doing the wireframes and user stories and adding them into your repository's issues and projects (you have to deliver them).
3. Create all the user stories with acceptance criteria.
4. Use a Kanban board for follow up on [Github Project Boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards).


## Building the Wireframe

A great way to polish your user stories is to draft off all your application wireframes.

Please create all the wireframes for your [application's Minimal Viable Product (MVP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joNKkWPafZs).

## Steps

- Start by building a sitemap.

- Then do the wireframe of your home page.

- Continue drawing on the most important pages.

- Every time you draw a page, identify and highlight the re-usable parts to convert them into components.

- Try to re-use everything all the time. The less code, the better!
  
- Keep it simple!
