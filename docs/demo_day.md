Your final presentation day marks the beginning of your coding career. Everything has to be perfect :smile:

The academy makes a great effort in giving you a great platform to shine:

- Invite your family to support you, there will be seats and refreshments for them to feel more comfortable.
- Be aware that some of our hiring partners could attend to the presentations looking for devs.
- Dress casual and remember we will be taking pictures.
- Presentations are recorded, published on the website and sent to our media partners.
- Finish a polished out version of your final project, make it look amazing!
- Your entire presentation should not be longer than 15 minutes.
- Students from recently started cohorts will also be attending.


## Instructions

- Create your google slides presentation [based on this one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oqRlXWC3rpC2mMGP5guac0rzEuEvBhDkf2aJdWG098s/edit#slide=id.p) but make it your own, change the design, add/remove slides, etc. But try to go over the same topics as the original presentation suggests.
- Prepare a 5 min live demonstration using the final project, make sure you won't encounter any bugs on that particular presentation flow, we will not allow video demonstrations.
