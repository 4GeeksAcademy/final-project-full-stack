# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32)  Full-Stack Final Project

It's time to thing about what you are going to be building, you'll have to develop an entire product, prepare a presentation & demonstrate the product and the idea to family, friends and hiring partners.

This project should be started after you have the class about Agile Development because you will have to create User Stories and a Kanban Board.

## Instrutions

1. Create the project repository (one for front-end and one for backend): The front-end code shout never be merged with the backend.
2. Add all your user stories into the front-end [repository issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues) as it will be the main repository for your project specs.
3. Please create a [Github Kanban Automated Project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) with the KANBAN columns: Backlog, Todo, Doing, Done.
4. Now add the issues into the project as cards, plan for your first iteration.


### Technological Requirements for the project:

1. Several HTML5 + CSS3 + Bootstrap pages.
2. User authentication (Login+Signup+Remind Password).
3. Custom made API with OAuth.
4. 3rd party API integration (embeds and iframes donâ€™t count), it has to be a back-end integration.
5. React.js application using Flux and React Router.
6. Anything else the student wants to add.

### Methodology Requirements

1. The project must have between 2 - 3 team members (3 is better than 2)
2. Start by doing the wireframes and user stories and add them into your repository issues and projects (you have to deliver them).
3. Create all the user stories with acceptance criteria.
4. Use a Kanban board for follow up on [Github Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)

# Building the Wireframe

A great way to polish your user stories is to draft of all your application wireframes.

Please create all the wireframes for your [application's MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joNKkWPafZs).

## Steps
- Start by building a sitemap
- Then do the wireframe of your home page.
- Continue drawing the most important pages.
- Everytime you draw a page, ideantify and highlite the re-usable parts to convert them into components.
- Try to re-use everything all the time. The less code, the better!
- Keep it simple!
